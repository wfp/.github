## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Dear all,
in this space, World Food Programme will publish Open Source Software available for the community.

For current members, please notice that we are going through a cleaning of the repositories (including the private ones) that are not receiving commits since the last three years. **These repositories will be removed within 1st of December 2024.** If you need to access these repositories please clone them on the WFP AzureDevOps instance following [this guideline](https://newgo.wfp.org/services/azure-devops).

Similarly, very soon, we will go through a review of the members, limiting it to the owners of the OSS projects.

Stay tuned!
